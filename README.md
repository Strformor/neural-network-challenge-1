## **Student Loan Risk Prediction Using Deep Learning**

This project employs **deep learning methodologies** to assess student loan risk by leveraging historical borrower data. The primary objective is to develop a **neural network model** using TensorFlow and Keras to classify loans as **high-risk or low-risk**, based on critical borrower attributes. By identifying patterns in financial behavior, the model aims to enhance predictive accuracy in loan approval processes, ultimately improving risk assessment in student lending.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset, `student-loans.csv`, contains key financial and demographic attributes that influence loan risk assessment. It is sourced externally via a URL and includes variables such as **credit history, loan amount, income level, and repayment history**—all essential factors in determining a borrower’s likelihood of default.  

## **Dependencies**  
The following Python libraries are required to execute the notebook:  

- `pandas` – for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- `tensorflow` – for constructing and training deep learning models  
- `scikit-learn` – for feature scaling, dataset splitting, and performance evaluation  
- `pathlib` – for handling file paths  

To install missing dependencies, use:  
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
```  

## **Workflow Overview**  

### **1. Data Preparation**  
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to assess data completeness, distribution, and potential biases.  
- Define independent features and target variables for training.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- Encode categorical variables into numerical representations.  
- Standardize numerical features using `StandardScaler` to enhance model convergence.  
- Partition the dataset into **training and testing subsets** for unbiased performance evaluation.  

### **3. Neural Network Development**  
- Design a **sequential neural network model** using Keras.  
- Integrate **dense layers** with appropriate activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).  
- Compile the model with a loss function and optimization algorithm suitable for classification tasks.  

### **4. Model Training**  
- Train the neural network using the preprocessed dataset.  
- Implement validation mechanisms to monitor overfitting and model generalizability.  

### **5. Model Evaluation**  
- Generate a **classification report** to analyze prediction effectiveness.  
- Identify potential model refinements to enhance predictive power.  

## **Execution Instructions**  
To execute the notebook, run each cell sequentially. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and the dataset is accessible before initiating the workflow.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance and mitigate overfitting.  
- Experimentation with alternative deep learning architectures (e.g., **convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**).  
- Integration of **external economic indicators** to improve model robustness.  
- Deployment of the trained model as a **REST API** for real-world loan risk assessment applications.
